This is well below Pennsylvania’s overall tract-level median income of about $70,000.\n- What elderly population threshold did you choose and why?\nI chose 17% elderly population as the threshold, which is slightly above the national average (~16–17%).\n- How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?\nThere are 524 census tracts in Pennsylvania that meet the vulnerability criteria.\n- What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition?\nAbout 7.3% of Pennsylvania’s 3,445 census tracts fall into this vulnerable category.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals \n\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Transform to appropriate projected CRS\ncensus_tracts_proj <- st_transform(census_tracts_demo, 5070)\nhospitals_proj <- st_transform(hospitals, 5070)\n\n# Calculate distance from each tract centroid to nearest hospital\ntract_centroids <- st_centroid(census_tracts_proj)\ndist_matrix <- st_distance(tract_centroids, hospitals_proj)\ntract_centroids$nearest_hosp_dist_m <- apply(dist_matrix, 1, min)\ntract_centroids$nearest_hosp_dist_mi <- tract_centroids$nearest_hosp_dist_m / 1609.34\n\nvulnerable_tracts_dist <- tract_centroids %>%\n  filter(vulnerable == 1) %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  select(GEOID, median_incomeE, pct_over65, nearest_hosp_dist_mi)\n\nsummary_stats <- summary(vulnerable_tracts_dist$nearest_hosp_dist_mi)\nsummary_stats\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    Min.  1st Qu.

Why or why not?\n7 tracts meet the definition. 2.8% of vulnerable tracts are undeserved.This result is not very surprising. Most of Pennsylvania’s population—and thus its healthcare infrastructure—is concentrated in urban and suburban counties. Rural areas may have some underserved tracts, but they are relatively few in number.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 6: Aggregate to County Level\n\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Spatial join tracts to counties\npa_counties_proj <- st_transform(pa_counties, 5070)\ntract_centroids_proj <- st_transform(tract_centroids, 5070)\ntracts_with_county <- st_join(tract_centroids_proj, pa_counties_proj, join = st_within)\n\n# Aggregate statistics by county\ncounty_stats <- tracts_with_county %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  group_by(COUNTY_NAM) %>%\n  summarize(\n    vulnerable_tracts = sum(vulnerable, na.rm = TRUE),\n    underserved_tracts = sum(underserved, na.rm = TRUE),\n    pct_underserved = ifelse(vulnerable_tracts > 0,\n                             100 * underserved_tracts / vulnerable_tracts, NA),\n    avg_distance_vuln_mi = mean(nearest_hosp_dist_mi[vulnerable == 1], na.rm = TRUE),\n    vulnerable_population = sum(over65[vulnerable == 1], na.rm = TRUE) # 65+ as proxy for vulnerable pop\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(pct_underserved))\n\nhead(county_stats, 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 10 × 6\n   COUNTY_NAM vulnerable_tracts underserved_tracts pct_underserved\n   <chr>                  <dbl>              <dbl>           <dbl>\n 1 CAMERON                    1                  1           100  \n 2 FOREST                     2                  2           100  \n 3 MONROE                     1                  1           100  \n 4 CLEARFIELD                 3                  2            66.7\n 5 JUNIATA                    2                  1            50  \n 6 ADAMS                      1                  0             0  \n 7 ALLEGHENY                 49                  0             0  \n 8 ARMSTRONG                  1                  0             0  \n 9 BEAVER                     8                  0             0  \n10 BEDFORD                    2                  0             0  \n# ℹ 2 more variables: avg_distance_vuln_mi <dbl>, vulnerable_population <dbl>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Required county-level statistics:**\n- Number of vulnerable tracts\n- Number of underserved tracts  \n- Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved\n- Average distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts\n- Total vulnerable population\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- Which 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts?\n- Which counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals?\n- Are there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?\n\nCameron (100%) – 1 vulnerable tract, and it is underserved.\nForest (100%) – 2 vulnerable tracts, both underserved.\nMonroe (100%) – 1 vulnerable tract, underserved.\nClearfield (66.7%) – 3 vulnerable tracts, 2 underserved.\nJuniata (50%) – 2 vulnerable tracts, 1 underserved.\nFrom the current table, counties like Cameron, Forest, and Clearfield stand out, because although they don’t have many tracts, nearly all of their vulnerable tracts are underserved and the average distance to the nearest hospital is 15–19 miles.\nYes. The underserved counties are concentrated in rural and sparsely populated areas (Northern and Central Pennsylvania: Cameron, Forest, Clearfield, Juniata). These counties have few hospitals and residents often face long travel times.\n---\n\n#### Step 7: Create Summary Table \n\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for

This StatePlane system minimizes distortion over Philadelphia and uses feet, which fits walk buffers and area calculations in miles/feet. The city publishes many layers in this CRS, so joins stay precise and distances do not inherit Web-Mercator scale errors.\n\nWhy a 0.25-mile threshold for younger students?\n\n0.25 mile ≈ 1,320 ft ≈ a 5-minute walk at ~3 mph (3 mi/hr → 264 ft/min; 5 min → 1,320 ft). A five-minute target reflects comfort and supervision needs for younger children.\nElementary pupils often walk more slowly, face more frequent stops, and require safer crossings. A 0.25-mile standard sets a conservative, child-appropriate access goal; 0.5 mile remains a reasonable secondary benchmark for older students and caregivers.\n\nThe map shows high elementary walk access across the urban core. Coverage drops at the edges of the city and in a few industrial or low-density tracts. With a 0.5-mile buffer, only a small share of tracts qualify as “deserts,” and most do not have large child populations. A stricter 0.25-mile buffer reveals more low-coverage tracts and brings a few high-child-count areas (42101034802 and 42101009300) into view. These priority tracts warrant near-term attention through safe-routes upgrades, school siting adjustments, or co-located youth services.\n\n## Finally - A few comments about your incorporation of feedback!\nTake a few moments to clean up your markdown document and then write a line or two or three about how you may have incorporated feedback that you recieved after your first assignment. \n\n---\n\n## Submission Requirements\n\n**What to submit:**\n\n1. **Rendered HTML document posted to your course portfolio** with all code, outputs, maps, and text\n   - Use `embed-resources: true` in YAML so it's a single file\n   - All code should run without errors\n   - All maps and charts should display correctly\n\n**File naming:** `LastName_FirstName_Assignment2.html` and `LastName_FirstName_Assignment2.qmd`\n\n---\n\n",
