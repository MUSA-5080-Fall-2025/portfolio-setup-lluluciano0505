The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.\n\nDrawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis\n- Evaluate data quality using margins of error \n- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making\n- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues\n- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/assignments/assignment_1/`\n\nMake sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an \"Assignments\" menu.\n\n# Part 1: Portfolio Integration\n\nCreate this assignment in your portfolio repository under an `assignments/assignment_1/` folder structure. Update your navigation menu to include:\n\n```\n- text: Assignments\n  menu:\n    - href: assignments/assignment_1/assignment_1.qmd\n      text: \"Assignment 1: Census Data Exploration\"\n```\nIf there is a special character like comma, you need use double quote mark so that the quarto can identify this as text\n\n# Setup\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load required packages\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n# Set your Census API key\ncensus_api_key(\"b236a5b2547ce79c3e203c3e1366ed7fa7b3d463\", install = FALSE)\nSys.getenv(\"CENSUS_API_KEY\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"b236a5b2547ce79c3e203c3e1366ed7fa7b3d463\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Choose your state for analysis\nmy_state <- \"Missouri\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n**State Selection:** I have chosen **Missouri** for this analysis because: major metropolitan areas (like St. Louis and Kansas City) with a large number of rural counties. This scenario can help to illustrate how data quality may vary between urban and rural areas, which is important for equitable policy decisions.\n\n# Part 2: County-Level Resource Assessment\n\n## 2.1 Data Retrieval\n\n**Your Task:** Use `get_acs()` to retrieve county-level data for your chosen state.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: county level\n- Variables: median household income (B19013_001) and total population (B01003_001)  \n- Year: 2022\n- Survey: acs5\n- Output format: wide\n\n**Hint:** Remember to give your variables descriptive names using the `variables = c(name = \"code\")` syntax.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Retrieve county-level ACS data for Missouri\ncounty_data <- get_acs(\n  geography = \"county\",\n  state = my_state,\n  variables = c(\n    median_income = \"B19013_001\",\n    total_pop = \"B01003_001\"\n  ),\n  year   = 2022,\n  survey = \"acs5\",\n  output = \"wide\"\n)\n\n# Clean county names: remove \", Missouri\" and \" County\"\ncounty_data <- county_data %>%\n  mutate(NAME = str_remove(NAME, \", Missouri\"),\n         NAME = str_remove(NAME, \" County\"))\n\n# Display the first few rows\nhead(county_data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  GEOID NAME     median_incomeE median_incomeM total_popE total_popM\n  <chr> <chr>             <dbl>          <dbl>      <dbl>      <dbl>\n1 29001 Adair             51020           4430      25299         NA\n2 29003 Andrew            68774           4776      18069         NA\n3 29005 Atchison          58521           3686       5270         NA\n4 29007 Audrain           51745           2309      24873         NA\n5 29009 Barry             55592           5385      34701         NA\n6 29011 Barton            48105           5576      11683         NA\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 2.2 Data Quality Assessment\n\n**Your Task:** Calculate margin of error percentages and create reliability categories.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Calculate MOE percentage: (margin of error / estimate) * 100\n- Create reliability categories:\n  -

For example, Mercer has just over 50,000 residents, yet its MOE reaches 18%. This suggests that smaller populations may lead to higher uncertainty in estimates, likely due to smaller sample sizes in the ACS survey. Carter, Shannon, and Ozark are located in Missouri’s Ozark region, an area characterized by both limited resources and highly dispersed populations. These factors can contribute to challenges in data collection, resulting in less reliable estimates.\n\n# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis\n\n## 3.1 Focus Area Selection\n\n**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for detailed tract-level study.\n\n**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability levels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to compare how data quality varies.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data\n# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties\nselected_counties <- income_reliability %>%\n  filter(\n    NAME %in% c(\"St. Louis\",    # High Confidence\n                \"Buchanan\",      # Moderate Confidence\n                \"Texas\")     # Low Confidence\n  ) %>%\n  select(\n    County = NAME,\n    `Median Income (Estimate)` = median_incomeE,\n    `MOE %` = income_moe_pct,\n    `Reliability` = reliability\n  )\n\n# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics\n# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\nselected_counties\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  County    `Median Income (Estimate)` `MOE %` Reliability        \n  <chr>                          <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>              \n1 Buchanan                       58303    5.07 Moderate Confidence\n2 St. Louis                      78067    1.64 High Confidence    \n3 Texas                          42870   11.4  Low Confidence     \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Comment on the output:** I selected St. Louis, Buchanan, and Texas counties to represent high, moderate, and low data reliability contexts—urban, mid-sized, and rural areas, respectively. \n\n## 3.2 Tract-Level Demographics\n\n**Your Task:** Get demographic data for census tracts in your selected counties.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: tract level\n- Variables: white alone (B03002_003), Black/African American (B03002_004), Hispanic/Latino (B03002_012), total population (B03002_001)\n- Use the same state and year as before\n- Output format: wide\n- **Challenge:** You'll need county codes, not names.

Consider questions about spatial patterns, time trends, or other demographic factors.]\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on [date]\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version [your version]\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: [your portfolio URL]\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\n[Describe any decisions you made about data processing, county selection, or analytical choices that might affect reproducibility]\n\n**Limitations:**\n[Note any limitations in your analysis - sample size issues, geographic scope, temporal factors, etc.]\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [ ] All code chunks run without errors\n- [ ] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [ ] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [ ] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [ ] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [ ] Census API key is properly set \n- [ ] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.
