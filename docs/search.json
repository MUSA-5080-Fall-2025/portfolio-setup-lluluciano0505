For example, Mercer has just over 50,000 residents, yet its MOE reaches 18%. This suggests that smaller populations may lead to higher uncertainty in estimates, likely due to smaller sample sizes in the ACS survey. Carter, Shannon, and Ozark are located in Missouri’s Ozark region, an area characterized by both limited resources and highly dispersed populations. These factors can contribute to challenges in data collection, resulting in less reliable estimates."
