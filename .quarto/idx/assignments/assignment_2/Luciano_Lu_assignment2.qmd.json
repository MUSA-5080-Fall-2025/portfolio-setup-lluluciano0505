most recent 5-year estimates\n\n# 2) Variables:\n# B01003_001 = total population\n# B19013_001 = median household income\n# B01001_020 + B01001_021 + B01001_044 + B01001_045 = age 65+ (male + female groups)\nvars <- c(\n  total_pop = \"B01003_001\",\n  median_income = \"B19013_001\",\n  male65_66   = \"B01001_020\",\n  male67_69   = \"B01001_021\",\n  male70_74   = \"B01001_022\",\n  male75_79   = \"B01001_023\",\n  male80_84   = \"B01001_024\",\n  male85plus  = \"B01001_025\",\n  female65_66 = \"B01001_044\",\n  female67_69 = \"B01001_045\",\n  female70_74 = \"B01001_046\",\n  female75_79 = \"B01001_047\",\n  female80_84 = \"B01001_048\",\n  female85plus= \"B01001_049\"\n)\n\n# 3) Pull ACS data at tract level for PA\npa_demo <- get_acs(\n  geography = \"tract\",\n  state = \"PA\",\n  variables = vars,\n  year = acs_year,\n  survey = \"acs5\",\n  output = \"wide\"\n)\n\n# 4) Compute elderly population (sum male+female 65+)\npa_demo <- pa_demo %>%\n  mutate(\n    over65 = male65_66E + male67_69E + male70_74E + male75_79E + \n             male80_84E + male85plusE + \n             female65_66E + female67_69E + female70_74E +\n             female75_79E + female80_84E + female85plusE\n  ) %>%\n  select(GEOID, total_popE, median_incomeE, over65)\n\n# 5) Join to tract boundaries\ncensus_tracts_demo <- census_tracts %>%\n  left_join(pa_demo, by = \"GEOID\")\n\n# How many tracts missing income?\nmissing_income <- sum(is.na(census_tracts_demo$median_incomeE))\n# Median income across all tracts (ignoring missing)\noverall_median_income <- median(census_tracts_demo$median_incomeE, na.rm = TRUE)\nlist(\n  acs_year_used = acs_year,\n  n_tracts = nrow(census_tracts_demo),\n  missing_income_tracts = missing_income,\n  median_income_all_tracts = overall_median_income\n)\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What year of ACS data are you using?\n- How many tracts have missing income data?\n- What is the median income across all PA census tracts?\n\nACS year used: 2022 (5-year estimates)\nNumber of census tracts in dataset: 3,445\nTracts with missing income data: 62\nMedian household income across all PA tracts: $70,188\n---\n\n#### Step 3: Define Vulnerable Populations \n\nIdentify census tracts with vulnerable populations based on TWO criteria:\n1. Low median household income (choose an appropriate threshold)\n2. Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate threshold)\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\n# 1) Define thresholds\nincome_threshold <- 50000 # $50,000 income\nelderly_pct_threshold <- 0.17 # 17% elderly\n\n# 2) Compute elderly percentage\ncensus_tracts_demo <- census_tracts_demo %>%\n  mutate(\n    pct_over65 = over65 / total_popE,\n    vulnerable = if_else(median_incomeE < income_threshold & pct_over65 > elderly_pct_threshold, 1, 0)\n  )\n\n# 3) Summary counts\nn_vulnerable <- sum(census_tracts_demo$vulnerable, na.rm = TRUE)\nn_total <- nrow(census_tracts_demo)\npct_vulnerable <- round(100 * n_vulnerable / n_total, 1)\n\nlist(\n  income_threshold = income_threshold,\n  elderly_threshold = elderly_pct_threshold,\n  vulnerable_tracts = n_vulnerable,\n  pct_vulnerable = pct_vulnerable\n)\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What income threshold did you choose and why\nI chose $50,000 as the income threshold. This is well below Pennsylvania’s overall tract-level median income of about $70,000.\n- What elderly population threshold did you choose and why?\nI chose 17% elderly population as the threshold, which is slightly above the national average (~16–17%).\n- How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?\nThere are 524 census tracts in Pennsylvania that meet the vulnerability criteria.\n- What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition?\nAbout 7.3% of Pennsylvania’s 3,445 census tracts fall into this vulnerable category.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals \n\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Transform to appropriate projected CRS\ncensus_tracts_proj <- st_transform(census_tracts_demo, 5070)\nhospitals_proj <- st_transform(hospitals, 5070)\n\n# Calculate distance from each tract centroid to nearest hospital\ntract_centroids <- st_centroid(census_tracts_proj)\ndist_matrix <- st_distance(tract_centroids, hospitals_proj)\ntract_centroids$nearest_hosp_dist_m <- apply(dist_matrix, 1, min)\ntract_centroids$nearest_hosp_dist_mi <- tract_centroids$nearest_hosp_dist_m / 1609.34\n\nvulnerable_tracts_dist <- tract_centroids %>%\n  filter(vulnerable == 1) %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  select(GEOID, median_incomeE, pct_over65, nearest_hosp_dist_mi)\n\nsummary_stats <- summary(vulnerable_tracts_dist$nearest_hosp_dist_mi)\nsummary_stats\n\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Use an appropriate projected coordinate system for Pennsylvania\n- Calculate distances in miles\n- Explain why you chose your projection\n\nThis projection uses meters as its unit, which avoids distortions from geographic CRS like WGS84 (degrees), so distances can be directly converted to miles.\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts?\n- What is the maximum distance?\n- How many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital?\n\nThe average distance is about 3.27 miles.\nThe maximum distance from a vulnerable tract centroid to the nearest hospital is about 18.6 miles.\nBy checking the distance distribution, only a small number of vulnerable tracts (likely fewer than 5) are more than 15 miles away.\n---\n\n#### Step 5: Identify Underserved Areas \n\nDefine \"underserved\" as vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Create underserved variable\ntract_centroids <- tract_centroids %>%\n  mutate(\n    underserved = if_else(vulnerable == 1 & nearest_hosp_dist_mi > 15, 1, 0)\n  )\n\nn_underserved <- sum(tract_centroids$underserved, na.rm = TRUE)\nn_vulnerable <- sum(tract_centroids$vulnerable, na.rm = TRUE)\npct_underserved <- round(100 * n_underserved / n_vulnerable, 1)\n\nlist(\n  underserved_tracts = n_underserved,\n  vulnerable_tracts_total = n_vulnerable,\n  pct_vulnerable_underserved = pct_underserved\n)\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- How many tracts are underserved?\n- What percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved?\n- Does this surprise you? Why or why not?\n7 tracts meet the definition. 2.8% of vulnerable tracts are undeserved.This result is not very surprising. Most of Pennsylvania’s population—and thus its healthcare infrastructure—is concentrated in urban and suburban counties. Rural areas may have some underserved tracts, but they are relatively few in number.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 6: Aggregate to County Level\n\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Spatial join tracts to counties\npa_counties_proj <- st_transform(pa_counties, 5070)\ntract_centroids_proj <- st_transform(tract_centroids, 5070)\ntracts_with_county <- st_join(tract_centroids_proj, pa_counties_proj, join = st_within)\n\n# Aggregate statistics by county\ncounty_stats <- tracts_with_county %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  group_by(COUNTY_NAM) %>%\n  summarize(\n    vulnerable_tracts = sum(vulnerable, na.rm = TRUE),\n    underserved_tracts = sum(underserved, na.rm = TRUE),\n    pct_underserved = ifelse(vulnerable_tracts > 0,\n                             100 * underserved_tracts / vulnerable_tracts, NA),\n    avg_distance_vuln_mi = mean(nearest_hosp_dist_mi[vulnerable == 1], na.rm = TRUE),\n    vulnerable_population = sum(over65[vulnerable == 1], na.rm = TRUE) # 65+ as proxy for vulnerable pop\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(pct_underserved))\n\nhead(county_stats, 10)\n\n```\n\n**Required county-level statistics:**\n- Number of vulnerable tracts\n- Number of underserved tracts  \n- Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved\n- Average distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts\n- Total vulnerable population\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- Which 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts?\n- Which counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals?\n- Are there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?\n\nCameron (100%) – 1 vulnerable tract, and it is underserved.\nForest (100%) – 2 vulnerable tracts, both underserved.\nMonroe (100%) – 1 vulnerable tract, underserved.\nClearfield (66.7%) – 3 vulnerable tracts, 2 underserved.\nJuniata (50%) – 2 vulnerable tracts, 1 underserved.\nFrom the current table, counties like Cameron, Forest, and Clearfield stand out, because although they don’t have many tracts, nearly all of their vulnerable tracts are underserved and the average distance to the nearest hospital is 15–19 miles.\nYes. The underserved counties are concentrated in rural and sparsely populated areas (Northern and Central Pennsylvania: Cameron, Forest, Clearfield, Juniata). These counties have few hospitals and residents often face long travel times.\n---\n\n#### Step 7: Create Summary Table \n\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for healthcare investment.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Create and format priority counties table\npriority_counties <- county_stats %>%\n  mutate(\n    `% Underserved` = round(pct_underserved, 1),\n    `Avg Distance (mi)` = round(avg_distance_vuln_mi, 1),\n    `Vulnerable Pop (65+)` = comma(vulnerable_population)\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(`% Underserved`), desc(as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\", `Vulnerable Pop (65+)`)))) %>%\n  slice(1:10) %>%\n  select(\n    County = COUNTY_NAM,\n    `Vulnerable Tracts` = vulnerable_tracts,\n    `Underserved Tracts` = underserved_tracts,\n    `% Underserved`,\n    `Avg Distance (mi)`,\n    `Vulnerable Pop (65+)`\n  )\n\nkable(\n  priority_counties,\n  caption = \"Top 10 Pennsylvania Counties with Highest Priority for Healthcare Investment (based on underserved vulnerable tracts and population needs)\",\n  align = \"lccccc\",\n  format = \"markdown\"\n)\n\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Use `knitr::kable()` or similar for formatting\n- Include descriptive column names\n- Format numbers appropriately (commas for population, percentages, etc.)\n- Add an informative caption\n- Sort by priority (you decide the metric)\n\n---\n\n## Part

)\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Show underserved vulnerable tracts in a contrasting color\n- Include county boundaries for context\n- Show hospital locations\n- Use appropriate visual hierarchy (what should stand out?)\n- Include informative title and subtitle\n\n---\n\n### Chart: Distribution Analysis\n\nCreate a visualization showing the distribution of distances to hospitals for vulnerable populations.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Create distribution visualization\nvuln <- tract_centroids %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  filter(vulnerable == 1)\n\nggplot(vuln, aes(x = nearest_hosp_dist_mi)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), bins = 30, fill = \"#4C78A8\", color = \"white\", alpha = 0.9) +\n  geom_density(linewidth = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title =

though a small number of rural tracts face much longer travel distances (up to ~18 miles).\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 11)\n\n```\n\n**Suggested chart types:**\n- Histogram or density plot of distances\n- Box plot comparing distances across regions\n- Bar chart of underserved tracts by county\n- Scatter plot of distance vs. vulnerable population size\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Clear axes labels with units\n- Appropriate title\n- Professional formatting\n- Brief interpretation (1-2 sentences as a caption or in text)\n\n---\n\n## Part 3: Bring Your Own Data Analysis \n\nChoose your own additional spatial dataset and conduct a supplementary analysis.\n\n### Challenge Options\n\nChoose ONE of the following challenge exercises, or propose your own research question using OpenDataPhilly data (https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/). \n\n**Note these are just loose suggestions to spark ideas - follow or make your own as the data permits and as your ideas evolve. This analysis should include bringing in your own dataset, ensuring the projection/CRS of your layers align and are appropriate for the analysis (not lat/long or geodetic coordinate systems).

This StatePlane system minimizes distortion over Philadelphia and uses feet, which fits walk buffers and area calculations in miles/feet. The city publishes many layers in this CRS, so joins stay precise and distances do not inherit Web-Mercator scale errors.\n\nWhy a 0.25-mile threshold for younger students?\n\n0.25 mile ≈ 1,320 ft ≈ a 5-minute walk at ~3 mph (3 mi/hr → 264 ft/min; 5 min → 1,320 ft). A five-minute target reflects comfort and supervision needs for younger children.\nElementary pupils often walk more slowly, face more frequent stops, and require safer crossings. A 0.25-mile standard sets a conservative, child-appropriate access goal; 0.5 mile remains a reasonable secondary benchmark for older students and caregivers.\n\nThe map shows high elementary walk access across the urban core. Coverage drops at the edges of the city and in a few industrial or low-density tracts. With a 0.5-mile buffer, only a small share of tracts qualify as “deserts,” and most do not have large child populations. A stricter 0.25-mile buffer reveals more low-coverage tracts and brings a few high-child-count areas (42101034802 and 42101009300) into view. These priority tracts warrant near-term attention through safe-routes upgrades, school siting adjustments, or co-located youth services.\n\n## Finally - A few comments about your incorporation of feedback!\nAfter the first assignment, I focused on making my analysis more structured and easier to read.

Low median household income (choose an appropriate threshold)\n2. Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate threshold)\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\n# 1) Define thresholds\nincome_threshold <- 50000 # $50,000 income\nelderly_pct_threshold <- 0.17 # 17% elderly\n\n# 2) Compute elderly percentage\ncensus_tracts_demo <- census_tracts_demo %>%\n  mutate(\n    pct_over65 = over65 / total_popE,\n    vulnerable = if_else(median_incomeE < income_threshold & pct_over65 > elderly_pct_threshold, 1, 0)\n  )\n\n# 3) Summary counts\nn_vulnerable <- sum(census_tracts_demo$vulnerable, na.rm = TRUE)\nn_total <- nrow(census_tracts_demo)\npct_vulnerable <- round(100 * n_vulnerable / n_total, 1)\n\nlist(\n  income_threshold = income_threshold,\n  elderly_threshold = elderly_pct_threshold,\n  vulnerable_tracts = n_vulnerable,\n  pct_vulnerable = pct_vulnerable\n)\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What income threshold did you choose and why\nI chose $50,000 as the income threshold. This is well below Pennsylvania’s overall tract-level median income of about $70,000.\n- What elderly population threshold did you choose and why?\nI chose 17% elderly population as the threshold, which is slightly above the national average (~16–17%).\n- How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?\nThere are 524 census tracts in Pennsylvania that meet the vulnerability criteria.\n- What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition?\nAbout 7.3% of Pennsylvania’s 3,445 census tracts fall into this vulnerable category.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals \n\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Transform to appropriate projected CRS\ncensus_tracts_proj <- st_transform(census_tracts_demo, 5070)\nhospitals_proj <- st_transform(hospitals, 5070)\n\n# Calculate distance from each tract centroid to nearest hospital\ntract_centroids <- st_centroid(census_tracts_proj)\ndist_matrix <- st_distance(tract_centroids, hospitals_proj)\ntract_centroids$nearest_hosp_dist_m <- apply(dist_matrix, 1, min)\ntract_centroids$nearest_hosp_dist_mi <- tract_centroids$nearest_hosp_dist_m / 1609.34\n\nvulnerable_tracts_dist <- tract_centroids %>%\n  filter(vulnerable == 1) %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  select(GEOID, median_incomeE, pct_over65, nearest_hosp_dist_mi)\n\nsummary_stats <- summary(vulnerable_tracts_dist$nearest_hosp_dist_mi)\nsummary_stats\n\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Use an appropriate projected coordinate system for Pennsylvania\n- Calculate distances in miles\n- Explain why you chose your projection\n\nThis projection uses meters as its unit, which avoids distortions from geographic CRS like WGS84 (degrees), so distances can be directly converted to miles.\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts?\n- What is the maximum distance?\n- How many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital?\n\nThe average distance is about 3.27 miles.\nThe maximum distance from a vulnerable tract centroid to the nearest hospital is about 18.6 miles.\nBy checking the distance distribution, only a small number of vulnerable tracts (likely fewer than 5) are more than 15 miles away.\n---\n\n#### Step 5: Identify Underserved Areas \n\nDefine \"underserved\" as vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Create underserved variable\ntract_centroids <- tract_centroids %>%\n  mutate(\n    underserved = if_else(vulnerable == 1 & nearest_hosp_dist_mi > 15, 1, 0)\n  )\n\nn_underserved <- sum(tract_centroids$underserved, na.rm = TRUE)\nn_vulnerable <- sum(tract_centroids$vulnerable, na.rm = TRUE)\npct_underserved <- round(100 * n_underserved / n_vulnerable, 1)\n\nlist(\n  underserved_tracts = n_underserved,\n  vulnerable_tracts_total = n_vulnerable,\n  pct_vulnerable_underserved = pct_underserved\n)\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- How many tracts are underserved?\n- What percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved?\n- Does this surprise you? Why or why not?\n7 tracts meet the definition. 2.8% of vulnerable tracts are undeserved.This result is not very surprising. Most of Pennsylvania’s population—and thus its healthcare infrastructure—is concentrated in urban and suburban counties. Rural areas may have some underserved tracts, but they are relatively few in number.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 6: Aggregate to County Level\n\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Spatial join tracts to counties\npa_counties_proj <- st_transform(pa_counties, 5070)\ntract_centroids_proj <- st_transform(tract_centroids, 5070)\ntracts_with_county <- st_join(tract_centroids_proj, pa_counties_proj, join = st_within)\n\n# Aggregate statistics by county\ncounty_stats <- tracts_with_county %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  group_by(COUNTY_NAM) %>%\n  summarize(\n    vulnerable_tracts = sum(vulnerable, na.rm = TRUE),\n    underserved_tracts = sum(underserved, na.rm = TRUE),\n    pct_underserved = ifelse(vulnerable_tracts > 0,\n                             100 * underserved_tracts / vulnerable_tracts, NA),\n    avg_distance_vuln_mi = mean(nearest_hosp_dist_mi[vulnerable == 1], na.rm = TRUE),\n    vulnerable_population = sum(over65[vulnerable == 1], na.rm = TRUE) # 65+ as proxy for vulnerable pop\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(pct_underserved))\n\nhead(county_stats, 10)\n\n```\n\n**Required county-level statistics:**\n- Number of vulnerable tracts\n- Number of underserved tracts  \n- Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved\n- Average distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts\n- Total vulnerable population\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- Which 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts?\n- Which counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals?\n- Are there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?\n\nCameron (100%) – 1 vulnerable tract, and it is underserved.\nForest (100%) – 2 vulnerable tracts, both underserved.\nMonroe (100%) – 1 vulnerable tract, underserved.\nClearfield (66.7%) – 3 vulnerable tracts, 2 underserved.\nJuniata (50%) – 2 vulnerable tracts, 1 underserved.\nFrom the current table, counties like Cameron, Forest, and Clearfield stand out, because although they don’t have many tracts, nearly all of their vulnerable tracts are underserved and the average distance to the nearest hospital is 15–19 miles.\nYes. The underserved counties are concentrated in rural and sparsely populated areas (Northern and Central Pennsylvania: Cameron, Forest, Clearfield, Juniata). These counties have few hospitals and residents often face long travel times.\n---\n\n#### Step 7: Create Summary Table \n\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for healthcare investment.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Create and format priority counties table\npriority_counties <- county_stats %>%\n  mutate(\n    `% Underserved` = round(pct_underserved, 1),\n    `Avg Distance (mi)` = round(avg_distance_vuln_mi, 1),\n    `Vulnerable Pop (65+)` = comma(vulnerable_population)\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(`% Underserved`), desc(as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\", `Vulnerable Pop (65+)`)))) %>%\n  slice(1:10) %>%\n  select(\n    County = COUNTY_NAM,\n    `Vulnerable Tracts` = vulnerable_tracts,\n    `Underserved Tracts` = underserved_tracts,\n    `% Underserved`,\n    `Avg Distance (mi)`,\n    `Vulnerable Pop (65+)`\n  )\n\nkable(\n  priority_counties,\n  caption = \"Top 10 Pennsylvania Counties with Highest Priority for Healthcare Investment (based on underserved vulnerable tracts and population needs)\",\n  align = \"lccccc\",\n  format = \"markdown\"\n)\n\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Use `knitr::kable()` or similar for formatting\n- Include descriptive column names\n- Format numbers appropriately (commas for population, percentages, etc.)\n- Add an informative caption\n- Sort by priority (you decide the metric)\n\n---\n\n## Part

This StatePlane system minimizes distortion over Philadelphia and uses feet, which fits walk buffers and area calculations in miles/feet. The city publishes many layers in this CRS, so joins stay precise and distances do not inherit Web-Mercator scale errors.\n\nWhy a 0.25-mile threshold for younger students?\n\n0.25 mile ≈ 1,320 ft ≈ a 5-minute walk at ~3 mph (3 mi/hr → 264 ft/min; 5 min → 1,320 ft). A five-minute target reflects comfort and supervision needs for younger children.\nElementary pupils often walk more slowly, face more frequent stops, and require safer crossings. A 0.25-mile standard sets a conservative, child-appropriate access goal; 0.5 mile remains a reasonable secondary benchmark for older students and caregivers.\n\nThe map shows high elementary walk access across the urban core. Coverage drops at the edges of the city and in a few industrial or low-density tracts. With a 0.5-mile buffer, only a small share of tracts qualify as “deserts,” and most do not have large child populations. A stricter 0.25-mile buffer reveals more low-coverage tracts and brings a few high-child-count areas (42101034802 and 42101009300) into view. These priority tracts warrant near-term attention through safe-routes upgrades, school siting adjustments, or co-located youth services.\n\n## Finally - A few comments about your incorporation of feedback!\nAfter the first assignment, I focused on making my analysis more structured and easier to read. I reorganized the Markdown file by grouping related visuals and adding short introductory sentences before each figure to explain its purpose.\n\n\n---\n\n## Submission Requirements\n\n**What to
